# Convolutional-Neural-Nets

These codes had the purpose for studying neural nets, and that only. 


- The "ConvNets in Small Datasets" has the purpose of working with convolutional neural networks modelling with small datasets, and how to avoid overfitting, by using data augmentation (a series of transformations to the images, in order to increase the data set lenght).

- The "Mnist" code has the purpose of studying how to create a neural net model to recoginze hand-written digits.



I've used "Fran√ßois Chollet"'s github codes to study and write these codes.

His github is an amazing source of knowledge and I'm greatfull for his work.
